## about this project

- My friends and I wanted to practice git commands, since everyone used different lenguage, one of them came up with that -- let's practice with going through a maze, all you need to do is type like "down 1 step, right 2 steps...".üëè

- We set up the order and everyone had to move forward five lines, when you finished your part, push the "instructions" to github and the next one continued.

- However, with those commands, it was inconvenient to see "where were we now", so I built this web page to let everyone could see it visually with the previous commands. 

- A team mate Judy-S helped to add color on it, anyone can chose a color and turned to be more clear. Thank you Judy-S! ü§©
