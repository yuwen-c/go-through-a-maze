# 關於走迷宮...

- 我和一群Data Science Enthusiastic 社團的朋友想一起練習Git commands, 但每個人使用不同的語言，於是其中一個人就想到...我們可以用走迷宮的方式來進行！👏
參與者只需要把像是這樣的指令："down 1 step, right 2 steps..." push上去就可以了。

- 主持人安排好迷宮的圖、順序，接著，輪到的人要前進一定的距離，並將指令放上github，下一個人繼續走。

- 但我們遇到一個麻煩，光是看前面的人的commands，不知道已經走到哪裡了...所以我做了這個迷宮模擬器，將路線「視覺化」，方便團友操作。

- 一位團友[Judy-S](https://github.com/Judy-S)還幫我加上顏色！謝謝 [Judy-S](https://github.com/Judy-S)! 🤩

# about this project

- My friends and I wanted to practice git commands, since everyone used different lenguage, one of them came up with that -- let's practice with going through a maze, all you need to do is type like "down 1 step, right 2 steps...".👏

- We set up the order and everyone had to move forward five lines, when you finished your part, push the "instructions" to github and the next one continued.

- However, with those commands, it was inconvenient to see "where were we now", so I built this web page to let everyone could see it visually with the previous commands. 

- A team mate [Judy-S](https://github.com/Judy-S) helped to add color on it, anyone can chose a color and turned to be more clear. Thank you [Judy-S](https://github.com/Judy-S)! 🤩
